This project is a programing assignment from the course "Practice of Fundamental Programming". And it is also the very first project that I have finished by myself after learning the basics of C++.

KTV-MUSIC is a console mini-program that implement the basic ktv management system. The project requirements are in the ppt "ktv_music_v1.0.pptx", and the user manual is in "实验1周3用户手册". All the procedures of code writing, debugging, and manual writing are finished within 3 weeks, which is a basic requirement of the course.

The project are finally scored 19/20.

**Being a KTV database manager**

This program allows you to add songs, delete songs, modify song infos of the ktv song database and deal with user's feedbacks using our "KTV administration system". You need to log in the admin account to manage the database.

**Picking your favorite songs in the KTV**

For users, you are allowed to pick songs from the database using pinyin/singer search, and manage your "already picked" songlist. You can also give feedback to the manager if you did not see the song you like in the list.
